# alpha space shooter
 A space shooter designed in the Ursina game engine, using python code.

 TODO: Re-Write player module to work with a spritesheet module
 TODO: Need to figure out why SpriteSheets have issues being destroyed
 TODO: Need to figure out why instances of the beams keep staying on screen
 TODO: Need to look deeper into the Ursina Source code for Cursor/mouse
 TODO: Need to figure out why look_at_2d keeps being disrupted when player starts moving, unsure if issue is related to (z) axis on spritesheet or player
